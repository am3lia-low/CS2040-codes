# the preface or something
Thought it would be nice to put it up here and practice my very weak GitHub skills.  
Semester: 2023/2024 Sem 2  
Taught by: (i forgot, brb)

#### Notes on my code:
I uploaded these files with no intention for them to be pulled off GitHub.  
The comments on my code are classic me; Full of yap, but somewhat explains the thought process going into them. See the tree code and you'll get what I mean.

Anyways, if you're taking this module, all the best! My only advice is to do some serious grinding over Reading Week.
