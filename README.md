Thought it would be nice to put it up here to practice my GitHub skills and save computer storage. 
Semester: 2023/2024 Sem 2  
Taught by: (i forgot, brb)

#### Notes on my code:
1. I uploaded these files with no intention for them to be pulled off GitHub. So please don't.
2. The comments on my code are classic me; Full of yap, but explains the thought process. See the tree assignment and you'll get what I mean.

Anyways, if you're taking this module, all the best!  
My advice is:
- do some serious past year paper grinding over Reading Week, especially the graphs
- [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en) is ur bestie  
got 14/75 for midterms, 70/100 for finals and A- final grade. believe in yourself!!
