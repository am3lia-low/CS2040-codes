Thought it would be nice to put it up here and practice my very weak GitHub skills.  
Semester: 2023/2024 Sem 2  
Taught by: (i forgot, brb)

#### Notes on my code:
1. I uploaded these files with no intention for them to be pulled off GitHub.
2. The comments on my code are classic me; Full of yap, but explains the thought process. See the tree assignment and you'll get what I mean.
3. I can't rmb if [T9Spelling](https://github.com/am3lia-low/CS2040-codes/blob/main/labs/T9Spelling.java) is the model answer or not ~~(but if you need help with that, I wish u atb moving forward.)~~

Anyways, if you're taking this module, all the best!  
My advice is:
- do some serious past year paper grinding over Reading Week, especially the graphs
- [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en) is ur bestie
